## Credits
Most credit goes to this tutorial website that helped me build out the major components of this and then try to figure out my own customization from there: https://www.sitepoint.com/simple-javascript-quiz/

Additionally had to utilize JSX which we haven't learned in class, but was used in that tutorial, so I had to go back and learn some of what that is: https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html

W3schools helped with a lot  of various javascript and CSS elements MOST importantly, the timer: https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_timing.asp
